          Understanding neuroplasticity can help improve our well-being. Knowing that our brain is malleable will increase our ability to learn new concepts that we thought we could never understand; improve our relationships as we now know that we can change our behaviours and personality and that we are not condemned to our old self or habits; and strengthen our capabilities because we know that we can do much better in time no matter our age. Learning about neuroplasticity can help us to be kind to ourselves, diminish limiting thoughts and practices, and improve all areas or aspects of our lives.

        ENGAGING WITH NEUROPLASTICITY FOR MY BENEFIT
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          Some of the principles emphasise specificity, repetition, and intensity. I can apply these principles to my current study at Dev Academy through practice and continuous learning. With the understanding that our brain changes through effort and time, continuous practice and learning will eventually help me to grasp information a bit more easily and my brain fire more effectively.

        SOME OF THE WAYS TO INCREASE NEUROPLASTICITY
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          Some of the ways that increase neuroplasticity, which I would like to adopt, are being specific to the skills that I want to improve, keep practicing the skills to strengthen the connections in the brain, improving my skills by introducing complex methods, using non-dominant exercises, traveling to new places, and also mindfulness exercises. These methods help open new neural pathways in the brain.

          A growth mindset is quite the opposite of a fixed mindset which means that the capacity to learn and improve, can be developed through effort and time. This can help people to be open to success as it will help them thrive during the most challenging times. A growth mindset is embracing challenges and sticking to them even when things are not going too well. This is quite relevant especially since we are learning new concepts on a fast track. Most areas seem to be blurry at the moment. However, incorporating a growth mindset in our learning journey can help us to keep going knowing that we will be able to understand the complexity of the concepts in time.

          There are many ways that I can integrate growth mindset into my learning journey. I can apply the power of yet and not be disheartened when I canâ€™t still figure out some things. I will be kind to myself by thinking more positively. I will keep practicing and learning to help prepare myself when challenges arise. I will remind myself that through practice and effort, my brain will be able to understand all these complexities and that I will be better at this. I will also have to avoid comparing myself to others. Incorporating a growth mindset can help improve my strengths and weaknesses.
