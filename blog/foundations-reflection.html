        WHAT ARE THE THREE NEW THINGS YOU HAVE LEARNED ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR EGO DUE TO THE CORE LEARNING?
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          The three new things I have learned about myself are being comfortable with an uncomfortable situation; being happy when presented with new challenges and problems, and being eager to learn more and new concepts. I have tried to accept and let go of my ego which does not support my learning. I have to keep reminding myself that I can easily understand the concepts and the problems, and keep in mind the power of yet.

        WHAT ARE THE ROLE OF VALUES, EMPATHY, AND SELF-AWARENESS IN LEARNING AND PROGRAMMING?
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          The values that we have will reflect on how we do our studies and work. It will guide us on how we will approach and finish the projects. It will help us prioritise the tasks at hand and to balance our life and school schedule. Our self-awareness will also help us to strengthen our limitations and give us hope so that we will keep on striving despite the difficulties we face when solving problems.

        WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT THE CORE LEARNING?
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          The thing that surprised me the most is that I am now quite comfortable being uncomfortable. I find it easier to accept the situation that every problem is unique and different and that it gets harder and harder each time. However, as we keep doing different challenges, my learning increases every time we finish a challenge.

      <div class="gridbox-b">
        WHAT WERE THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF THE CORE LEARNING?
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          The most challenging aspects of the core learning are trying to dive deeper into yourself to identify your values, strengths and identity, and how to apply the core learning to your daily life in school and activities.

        WHY DO YOU THINK WE, A PROGRAMMING SCHOOL, ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME FOCUSING ON CORE LEARNING IN A WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP COURSE?
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          The school is spending so much time focusing on core learning because human skills are as important as technical skills in this industry. We do not just write codes but we also interact with other people. Core learning has personally helped me survive foundations. It has given me the strength to strive more and not give up. It has also helped me to understand that we still have the capability to learn new concepts. Core learning has served as a guide especially when things get a bit harder.

      <div class="gridbox-b">
        DOES THE TIME YOU SPENT STUDYING CORE LEARNING HERE FEEL LIKE A WASTE OF TIME? SHOULD YOU HAVE JUST USED THAT TIME TO PRACTISE PROGRAMMING INSTEAD? JUSTIFY YOUR ANSWER.
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          The time spent studying core has been a great help especially when things get a bit more difficult. It will help you not to give up on yourself and to believe in yourself that you can actually do this. It will give you hope that you still have the capability to learn something new and that if you just keep going, the time will come when things will become a bit easier to comprehend. When you feel drowned with difficult problems, it always feels good to go back to core learning.
