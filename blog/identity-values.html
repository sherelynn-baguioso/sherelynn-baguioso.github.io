      <div class="gridbox-b">SITUATION WHERE I MADE AN ETHICAL DECISION</div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          There was one personal situation where I made an ethical decision. It was when my mom was critically ill. In our culture, we tend to preserve life even if the quality is already compromised. This is quite typical especially if the relatives have no medical background and do not understand the situation of the dying. Since there was no advance directive, someone in the family had to decide whether to continue or stop treatment and whether to intubate or not in case her heart stops. Since my father was still away at that time when it happened, he wanted to continue her treatment and therapy because for him that seemed to be the right thing to do. However, upon assessing my mom, the most humane thing to do is to just provide palliative care and make her comfortable as much as possible. She somehow implicitly expressed during those few moments that she would be awake, that she wanted to just go home and rest. Surprisingly, a couple of her doctors would still push treatment which makes it confusing for the family and relatives even if the main doctor had said that the body could not take it anymore. So just to cut things short, I signed the DNR for my mom because the rest of my family couldn’t and we took her home against my father’s will as he would have wanted her to stay in the hospital and continue treatment. However, I knew that I made the right decision because when we were on our way home and noticed she was somehow awake, I asked her if she was happy that we were going home and she nodded. The short period of restlessness was gone when she was home and she was just sleeping the whole time until finally, she decided to let go. Reflecting on this, no one would want to lose a loved one but what I did was to show compassion and respect for a dying person’s wish to not be in pain and just to have a peaceful passing. Some people may not understand but I know that my mom did.

        HOW CULTURE AND PEOPLE INFLUENCED MY VALUES AND IDENTITY
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          My culture and the people around me had shaped me to always do the right thing and to be respectful to everyone, especially the elderly. I used to be very conservative due to society’s norms and my parents’ influence as well.  I was raised in quite an uptight environment. But I cannot say that nothing has changed. Change is inevitable and as humans, we tend to evolve. I can say that I had some self-awareness and my experiences contributed a lot to my personality. There are values that I retained purposefully and some I had to let go of. I have become open-minded. I try to be whom I want to be but I do not impose my values on anyone. I let people off the hook and let them be.

        STRENGTHS THAT WILL SUPPORT MY LEARNING JOURNEY
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          One of my strengths is I do things with integrity. I would try my best to meet goals as much as possible and with the best I can. If it is something that I would love to do or am motivated to do, time just seems to pass by unnoticeably. I think this will help me in my journey to keep going especially with the challenges that this course presents.

        LIMITATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT MY LEARNING JOURNEY
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          I am very new to this industry and I have a lot of learnings to catch up on, especially since technology seems to change quite rapidly. One of my limitations is that I might not be disciplined in some areas. I try to balance everything but there are times that I tend to compromise other things. Another limitation is I hesitate to ask for help. I noticed that I would be stuck for more than 30 minutes but I would still not sing out. Although I’m trying to change it by asking for support from the group and it wasn’t too bad at all and a little bit liberating.

        TENSION AT WORK: STRATEGIES AND REFLECTIONS
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          In my previous workplace, you have to collaborate and work together with other people to achieve a common goal in a limited time. However, if people can’t work peacefully together that’s when it becomes chaotic. I tried to keep the complaints as objective and as factual as possible. I tried to separate the people involved at that time and had to rearrange the assigned tasks to maintain a harmonious workplace. If they needed help, I or different people would assist them. I reminded them to put the clients’ needs first before their conflicts and differences. The tasks had been done but their conflict was not resolved. It was just like putting a band-aid on a wound. Reflecting upon it, I don’t know what I could have done differently. Maybe if we had been given enough time afterwards then we could have discussed the root cause and cultural differences.
