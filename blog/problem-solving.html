        <p>
          In a healthcare setting before, if we were presented with a health problem, the first thing we would do is assess the problem thoroughly. Once we have the full assessment, we can now diagnose what it is. But before doing something, you need to have a plan first before applying your interventions. After the interventions, you can now evaluate if you have met your goals or not. This is quite a systematic way of tackling your problems and making sure that you did not miss a thing. This has helped me to become organised and thorough.

      <div class="gridbox-b">A situation where I elegantly solved a problem.</div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          When it comes to the tech part, I cannot say that I have elegantly solved a problem but I have learned a lot about how to tackle them. I have realised that pseudocode is really important because it will give you a breakdown of the steps on how to solve a certain problem. It will unload the stress of being overwhelmed. Once you have written the steps, you can now focus on each of them one at a time until you can connect all the pieces together. Although there are times when I forget to write the pseudocode because I thought that “I’ve got this” but then it turns out the code was not working and I will have to rethink all over again as to where I am at. Reading the errors has become very helpful because it targets the problem itself, thus, you do not have to keep on second guessing. Also, console.logging out the result of your code has also been beneficial because knowing the result will let you know if you are on the right track. And of course, googling and asking for help should always be two of our helplines. They help you understand better and in a timely manner.

        <H2>Pseudocode</H2>
        <p>
          If I find the problem quite difficult, pseudocode helps, because it breaks down the process and I can focus on each step one at a time. If I have an explanation of what I’m thinking and doing, then it helps with tackling and understanding the problem.

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Trying Something</h2>
        <p>
          I think I do this most of the time, as there are so many ways to write the code, trying something will let me know if it works or not. Trying something will also add to the new things I have discovered.

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Rubber Ducky Method</h2>
        <p>
          I have not done the rubber ducky but I find talking to myself and asking myself was quite helpful because it helps me to think differently and review the steps that I have done. I also find myself answering myself back which is kind of crazy but still it helps.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Reading Error Messages</h2>
        <p>
          I have come to realise the usefulness of error messages because it helps me target the problem in my code. It will let you know the line number, if it is not defined, or if it is a syntax error and many more.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Console.logging</h2>
        <p>
          This has helped me a lot with letting me know if the code did really print the result or the output that I expected. This is quite helpful after creating a function and testing my code. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Googling</h2>
        <p>
          I am very dependent on google now. It’s already automatic. When I am not familiar with the approach then google is definitely the next step. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
        <p>
          As the days go by, I find it easier now to ask for help. It gets you unstuck easily and when you discuss it with them, you learn more as well. I also find it valuable when I get to help someone because it gets me to review again the problem that I have once encountered before, so it's still learning all over again at the same time.

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
        <p>
          Asking coaches is one of the life savers. I also find it easier now to ask for their help. I learn and understand better when they explain the problem at hand and the solution it entails.

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
        <p>
          When I learn something new and then I connect it with non-tech processes like the reflections, it actually boosts the things that I have learned
