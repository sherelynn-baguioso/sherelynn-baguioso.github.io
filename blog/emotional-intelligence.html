      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is having self-awareness of oneâ€™s emotions and the ability to identify, evaluate, control and manage them. It is also having the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others. This is a skill that can be learned and developed. Emotionally intelligent people are aware of their emotional states, both positive and negative. They can recognise and understand what they are and other people are feeling, and use them as part of their decision-making and problem-solving skills. They are not impulsive and they first analyse their feelings before they get into action. With this, they can regulate their emotions and have the ability to reduce the intensity when necessary. Emotional intelligence is one of the skills that great leaders possess.</p>

On the other hand, emotional intelligence is the ability to use your sense of emotions when dealing with other people, challenges or problems, conflicts, or any situation. It refers to your self-awareness of your emotions as a guide to your behaviour.</p>
