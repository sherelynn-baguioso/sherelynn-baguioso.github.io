          <div class="gridbox-b">MY LONG-TERM GOAL OR CAREER PATHWAY</div>
          <div class="gridbox-a">
            <p>My long-term goal is to be able to work and hone my skills as a software developer. I am also hoping I could land in a software consulting company so I can gain different experiences and have a steady growth.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gridbox-b">MY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</div>
          <div class="gridbox-a">
            <p>I have noticed lately that my perseverance is quite strong even though everything is overwhelming and sometimes intimidating. However, pushing myself helped me to get through even if I donâ€™t even know where to start. Some of my limitations are still finding it hard to ask for help and not keeping to the timebox recommended.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gridbox-b">HUMAN SKILLS I WOULD TO LIKE TO SEE DEVELOPED</div>
          <div class="gridbox-a">
            <p>The human skills that I want to develop are communication, self-awareness and a growth mindset. I want to be able to communicate effectively and overcome shyness. I also want to be able to know and reflect on myself more. Moreover, with a growth mindset, I want to be able to thrive on every challenge and not be dismayed by obstacles and setbacks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gridbox-b">COMMITMENT ON HOW I WILL MANAGE MY WORK ON THIS PROGRAMME</div>
          <div class="gridbox-a">
            <p>I would commit to working every day and finishing the assigned tasks or projects within the allowed timeframe. When things start to build up, I would have to reassess the situation and discuss it with the facilitators and groupmates so I would not be left behind and would not have to drag the team down.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gridbox-b">HOW AND WHERE I WILL SEEK HELP IN A TIMELY WAY</div>
          <div class="gridbox-a">
            <p>I would check discord and google to see if anyone has already solved the problem. If not, then ask for help from experts although asking for help has always been a struggle for me. However, as per advice, I should seek help if I am stuck for more than 15 minutes so I could get going and finish within the allotted time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gridbox-b">MY EXPECTATIONS FROM THE FACILITATION TEAM</div>
          <div class="gridbox-a">
            <p>I expect from the facilitation team that they would support us with our learning journey, provide hints to overcome challenges when we are completely stuck, and provide lots of feedback on our work so we could apply the best practices and help improve our problem-solving skills.</p>
