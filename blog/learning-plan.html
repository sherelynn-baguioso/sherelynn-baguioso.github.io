        <p>
          Since I do not have much programming experience compared to other people who have their degrees and who have been in this industry for quite some time, I am really hoping to be accepted into a good company, probably a software consulting firm, where I can practice a variety of skills and experience growth in my career.

        WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR BIGGEST STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS WILL BE IN BOOTCAMP?
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          My biggest strength is that I am determined to finish this course and to learn as much. I am very motivated to learn and persevere in this chosen career. One of my limitations in Bootcamp is that I am quite anxious because I still yet have a lot to learn and I am afraid that my pacing would not match my partner’s pacing during pair programming.

          The human skills that I would like to see developed would be communication skills, leadership skills, pairing with others, and also giving feedback.

          I expect that there will be a bit of teaching and some coaching by the facilitators during Bootcamp. I expect that the facilitators will guide us and provide feedback on our progress.

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          Even though I am not yet certain about my pacing but I hope that I will be able to manage my time properly and ask for help in a timely manner by reaching out to my partner during pair programming or asking the facilitators if they could guide me to the best way possible.

          My long-term goal is to be able to work and hone my skills as a software developer. I am also hoping I could land in a software consulting company so I can gain different experiences and have a steady growth.

        A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING.
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          I have noticed lately that my perseverance is quite strong even though everything is overwhelming and sometimes intimidating. However, pushing myself helped me to get through even if I don’t even know where to start. Some of my limitations are still finding it hard to ask for help and not keeping to the timebox recommended.

        WHAT SKILLS (NON-TECHNICAL) WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE DEVELOPED IN YOURSELF WHILE AT DEV ACADEMY?
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          The human skills that I want to develop are communication, self-awareness and a growth mindset. I want to be able to communicate effectively and overcome shyness. I also want to be able to know and reflect on myself more. Moreover, with a growth mindset, I want to be able to thrive on every challenge and not be dismayed by obstacles and setbacks.

      <div class="gridbox-b">
        A COMMITMENT TO HOW YOU WILL MANAGE YOUR WORKLOAD IN THIS PROGRAM.
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          I would commit to working every day and finishing the assigned tasks or projects within the allowed timeframe. When things start to build up, I would have to reassess the situation and discuss it with the facilitators and groupmates so I would not be left behind and would not have to drag the team down.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-b">
        A COMMITMENT AS TO HOW AND WHERE YOU WILL SEEK HELP IN A TIMELY WAY.
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          I would check discord and google to see if anyone has already solved the problem. If not, then ask for help from experts although asking for help has always been a struggle for me. However, as per advice, I should seek help if I am stuck for more than 15 minutes so I could get going and finish within the allotted time.

      <div class="gridbox-b">
        A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM THE FACILITATION TEAM.
      </div>

      <div class="gridbox-a">
        <p>
          I expect from the facilitation team that they would support us with our learning journey, provide hints to overcome challenges when we are completely stuck, and provide lots of feedback on our work so we could apply the best practices and help improve our problem-solving skills.
